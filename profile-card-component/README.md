This is a solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). With Frontend Mentor challenges I want to improve
my Frontend-Skills and have fun by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This challenge is about building out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the following design as possible.

## Learnings

- let one element overlap the other
```css
.img {
  position: relative;
  top: -12px;
  z-index: 100;
}
```

- multiple backgrounds possible - simply separate by comma

- position background with background-position property
