# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section solution

This is a solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). With Frontend Mentor challenges I want to improve my Frontend-Skills and have fun by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This challenge is about building out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the following design as possible.
The user should be able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

## Learnings

- setting html height-property to 100% helped positioning the right bottom background-image

- use CSS flexbox to control layout along one dimension
- use CSS grid to control layout in two dimensions
  - grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows
  - by default container has one grid item for each column in each row
    -> but you can style the grid items
  - grid-template-columns for example defines number of columns in grid layout
    -> each values defines width of column
